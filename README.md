# ZINC22_LibraryPrep
This is a repository about virtual library preparation. 
- First, the 2D structures of molecules that could be purchashed were downloaded in SMILES formats. (Hevay atom number 17-25, logP values -5 to 3.4)
- Obtained molecules were cleaned up as they contained duplicates in terms of ZINCID, Catalog ID and Supplier Information.
- There were filtering of molecules also
